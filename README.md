# Python Problem Solving – Numbers

This repository contains Python programs that solve various number-based problems. These solutions help in understanding mathematical logic, loops, and conditional statements while improving problem-solving skills.

# Project Overview
This project includes solutions to the following problems:

# Number Properties & Checks
- Automorphic Number – Checks if a number’s square ends with the number itself.
- Abundant Number – Determines if a number is abundant (sum of divisors > number).
- Armstrong Number – Verifies if a number is an Armstrong number.
- Even or Odd – Determines if a number is even or odd.
- Harshad Number (Niven Number) – Checks if a number is divisible by the sum of its digits.
- Palindrome Number – Checks if a number reads the same forward and backward.
- Perfect Number – Verifies if a number is perfect (sum of its divisors excluding itself equals the number).
- Prime Number Check – Determines if a number is prime.

# Factorization & Divisibility
- Factors of a Number – Finds all divisors of a number.
- GCD of Two Numbers – Computes the Greatest Common Divisor.
- LCM of Two Numbers – Finds the Least Common Multiple.
- Prime Factors – Determines prime factors of a number.

# Mathematical Calculations
- Factorial Calculation – Computes the factorial of a number.
- Fibonacci Series – Generates Fibonacci numbers up to a given limit.
- Power of a Number – Calculates exponentiation.
- Roots of a Quadratic Equation – Finds roots of a quadratic equation.

#  Comparisons & Ranges
- Greatest of Three Numbers – Finds the largest among three numbers.
- Greatest of Two Numbers – Determines the maximum of two numbers.
- Max and Min Digits in a Number – Identifies the largest and smallest digits in a number.
- Palindromes in a Range – Finds all palindrome numbers in a given range.
- Primes in a Range – Lists all prime numbers within a specified range.
- Sum of Two Primes – Checks if a number can be expressed as the sum of two primes.

# Other Logical Programs
- Leap Year or Not – Determines if a year is a leap year.
- Reverse a Number – Reverses the digits of a given number.
- Replace 0 with 1 – Replaces all zeros in a number with ones.
- Permutations of a Number – Generates all possible permutations of the given digits.
